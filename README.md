## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Requirements for starting the app:

Clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/vikpande/readable.git
```

The repo has two projects a client and a server ( client is a react app and the server is a nodejs) ,

- Client - Has the react client application

- Server - Has the node server application

Change to server directory (cd server) and run the following commands on your terminal

```
cd api-server 
```
```
yarn OR npm install
```

```
yarn start or npm start
```
At this point your node server starts and is rendered on port 3001


Now change to client directory (cd client) and install:

```
cd client 
```
```
yarn OR npm install
```

```
yarn start or npm start
```
You can now view the web-app on your localhost on port 3000
