# Readable project  
- Part of the Nanodegree course. This webapp uses React, Redux and Thunk

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Requirements for starting the app:

Clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/vikpande/readable.git
```

The repo has two projects a client and a server ( client is a react app and the server is a nodejs) ,

- Client - Has the react client application

- Server - Has the node server application

this directory has only the client server : Change to server directory (cd client ) and run the following commands on your terminal

```
cd client 
```
```
yarn OR npm install
```

```
yarn start or npm start
```
You can now view the web-app on your localhost on port 3000
